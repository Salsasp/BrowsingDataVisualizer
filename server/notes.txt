The app directory
For new applications, we recommend using the 
App Router. This router allows you to use React's 
latest features and is an evolution of 
the Pages Router based on community feedback.

(using .js instead of .tsx)
Create an app/ folder, then add a layout.tsx and 
page.tsx file. These will be rendered when the 
user visits the root of your application (/).

The public folder (optional)
Create a public folder to store static assets 
such as images, fonts, etc. 
Files inside public directory can then be 
referenced by your code starting from the base URL (/).

TO RUN DEV SERVER

Run npm run dev to start the development server.
Visit http://localhost:3000 to view your application.
Edit app/layout.tsx (or pages/index.tsx) file and 
save it to see the updated result in your browser.
